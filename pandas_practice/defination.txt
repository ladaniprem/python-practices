why use pandas ?
a. performance :-  Handles millions of rows efficiently
b. Ease of Use :- Beginner-friendly syntax for cleaning and transforming data 
c. Integration :- works with library like matplotlib(visualizations) and scikit-learn

Series:-
A series is a one-dimensional labeled array that can hold any data type : intergers,floats,strings,or even python objects.each element in the series has a unique label called an index.
