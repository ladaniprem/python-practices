## Pandas Learning Flow

This document maps a clear learning path using the files already present in this workspace under `pandas_practice/basic pandas` and `pandas_practice/advance pandas` (including `Handling Missing Data`). Use it as a study checklist and quick reference to run the example scripts.

### How to use

- Start at the top (Prerequisites), then follow the Basic section. Spend time running and editing the example scripts. Move to Advanced once comfortable with DataFrame basics and I/O.
- Each step lists the most relevant file(s) to open and experiment with, a short goal, and a suggested time estimate.

---

## Prerequisites (10–30 minutes)

- Python 3.8+ installed and a working virtual environment (venv or conda).
- Install pandas if you don't have it:

```powershell
pip install pandas openpyxl
```

- Quick refresh: basic Python skills (lists, dicts, functions). See parent repo files if needed.

## Basic pandas (1.5–3 hours total)

Work through these in order. Open the files in `pandas_practice/basic pandas`.

1) Overview & vocabulary — `defination.txt`, `topic.py` (10–15m)
 - Goal: Understand Series, DataFrame, index, columns, dtype.
 - Activity: Read definitions, then open `topic.py` and inspect any example code.

2) Loading and saving data — `app.py`, `output.csv`, `output.json`, `output.xlsx`, `sample_Data.json`, `SampleSuperstore.xlsx`, `data.txt` (20–45m)
 - Goal: Learn reading CSV, JSON, and Excel and writing back to disk.
 - Activity: Run `app.py`, locate read_*and to_* calls. Modify paths to try writing a small transformed file.

3) Inspecting data — `describe.py`, `in.py` (15–30m)
 - Goal: Use `.head()`, `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.value_counts()`.
 - Activity: Run `describe.py` and inspect printed summaries.

4) Row and column operations — `rows.py`, `rowsfilter.py`, `save.py` (20–40m)
 - Goal: Select rows/columns, filter data, save selection.
 - Activity: Create a filter (e.g., sales > X) and save filtered results with `save.py`.

5) Small guided example — `examplestep5.py`, `step5.txt` (15–30m)
 - Goal: Follow a small multi-step example integrating loading, filtering, and saving.
 - Activity: Step through the example and modify one transformation.

6) Practice files and exercises — `problem.txt`, `data.txt`, `sales_data_sample.csv` (remaining time)
 - Goal: Try solving the problems listed in `problem.txt` using pandas operations above.

Tip: Keep a scratch notebook or script and re-run small code cells after each change.

## Advanced pandas (2–4 hours)

After you’re comfortable with Basic, move here. Open `pandas_practice/advance pandas`.

1) Updating and modifying data — `updating.py`, `updating2.py`, `adding.py`, `removing.py` (30–60m)
 - Goal: Learn how to add/remove columns and rows, update values in-place, set indexes.
 - Activity: Run these scripts and try converting a column to datetime, then set it as an index.

2) Handling Missing Data (Core topic) — `Handling Missing Data/handle.py`, `handle2.py`, `missing.py`, `missing.txt` (45–90m)
 - Goal: Detect missing values, use `.dropna()`, `.fillna()`, and interpolation techniques.
 - Activity: Use `missing.py` examples to create masks, replace NaNs, and evaluate results. Try different strategies from `missing.txt` notes.

Advanced exercises

- Combine multiple files: load `SampleSuperstore.xlsx`, clean with missing-data strategies, add derived columns (e.g., total price), and save a cleaned version.
- Time series hint: convert columns containing dates to datetime dtype and practice resampling (monthly sums).

---

## Suggested learning schedule (example)

- Day 1: Prereqs + Basic steps 1–3 (1–2 hours)
- Day 2: Basic steps 4–6 + 1 simple project (1–2 hours)
- Day 3: Advanced updates + Missing data (1–2 hours)

## Quick project ideas (mini capstones)

- Clean sales data and produce a monthly sales summary CSV.
- Build a small ETL: read Excel, clean missing values, derive new metrics, and save to JSON.

## Running the examples

- Open a terminal in the `pandas_practice` folder and run scripts with:

```powershell
python "basic pandas\app.py"
python "advance pandas\Handling Missing Data\missing.py"
```

Adjust paths if your shell’s working directory is different.

## Next steps and improvements

- Add short README headers to each example script describing inputs/outputs and expected behavior.
- Add unit tests for small data transformations (pytest + tiny CSV fixtures).
- Add a Jupyter notebook that walks through a single dataset from raw -> clean -> analyze.

---

If you'd like, I can also:

- create a short Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the full flow with `SampleSuperstore.xlsx` as a walkthrough, or
- add README headers to each example script automatically.

Tell me which next step you prefer and I'll implement it.
