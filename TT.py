# Turtle code
"""
Turtle Graphics Theory:

1. Basic Concepts:
    - Turtle graphics simulates a turtle with a pen moving on a canvas
    - The turtle can move forward/backward and turn left/right
    - Commands build drawings step by step

2. Main Components:
    - Screen: The drawing canvas
    - Turtle: The drawing cursor
    - Pen: Controls line properties (color, width)

3. Common Commands:
    - forward()/backward(): Move turtle
    - right()/left(): Rotate turtle
    - penup()/pendown(): Control drawing
    - color(): Set pen color
    - begin_fill()/end_fill(): Fill shapes

4. Coordinates:
    - Default (0,0) is screen center
    - Positive x is right
    - Positive y is up
